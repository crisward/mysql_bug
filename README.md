# mysql_bug

This is a small repo to demo a bug in the crystal-db / crystal-mysql

I'm not sure which, but I thought I'd create this min example to help explain.

Just run Crystal spec (with a local mysql running)

It'll create a database called mysql_bug and then remove it at the end.

## Installation

```
crystal deps
```
